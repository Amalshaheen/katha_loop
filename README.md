### Project Description
"Katha Loop" is a fun, random prompt generator that loops infinitely, creating a chain of silly scenarios and nonsensical predictions. It‚Äôs perfect for sparking creativity and laughter without any serious purpose.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are often faced with too much meaningful content. Where‚Äôs the app that serves up pure, pointless fun?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
"Katha Loop" solves this by delivering endless absurd scenarios based on random user input, letting people explore a world of useless stories.
